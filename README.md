# CoreML Models
## Introduction
This is a repo containing some popular & useful CoreML models. The summery of those models can be found below and details are included in the repo. 

# What's CoreML
CoreML is the machine learning library released by Apple at WWDC 2017. It's mained used for using pretrained machine learning models on Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. CoreML takes advantages of both the CPU (Accelerate Framework) and also the GPU (Metal 2) to run large large neural networks quickly and efficiently. Note, you must have iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and other latest frameworks to run CoreML.
